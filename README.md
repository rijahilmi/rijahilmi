<font size="1"> Hi there! Nice to meet you! :smile_cat:

My name is Rija Akhal Hilmi, you can call me Rija. I am 20 years old. I am a 4th year Aerospace :airplane::rocket: Engineering student at Bandung Institute of Technology. Currently, I am very interested in optimizing-based cases and ways to solve it faster, better, and more efficient. That is why I need to learn Machine Learning. To provide my goal, I choose to learn Python as a language used for Machine Learning. Why? Because I like it! :heart_eyes:
  
To refresh my spirit and kill my boredom, I usually do those things:    
* Travel to exotic places! :motorcycle:     
* Play the guitar :guitar: and sing ðŸŽ¶ 
* Play video games :video_game:  (Damn, Cyberpunk 2077, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Watch Dogs: Legion are looking lit! :fire:)
* Swimming (too bad COVID-19 makes every swimming pool facility closes!)

To progress my goal further, I am currently looking for learning partner related to Aerospace, Structural, and Machine Learning. Every help is appreciated!
